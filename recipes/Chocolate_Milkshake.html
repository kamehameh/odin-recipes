    <h2> Chocolate Milkshake </h2>
    <p>    Who doesn't like milkshake. This milk bevarage is not only tasty but also healthy.
        Today, we will look how to make this delicious milk based chocolate drink that will 
        make you feel refresh. </p>
        
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
      <ul>
        <ls>MIlk - 200ml</ls>
        <ls>Chocolate - 30g</ls>
        <ls>Sugar - as per your need</ls>
      </ul>
      <strong>Let's get started</strong>
      <p>    Pour some milk(approx.200) in pan and boil it at low temperature.  After you 
        observe white foam forming on the top, take the bowl and cool it at normal temperature.
        (<em> please don't keep that hot bowl directly after heating in freezer unless you don't  
        want to see an explostion of nitrogen gas<em> :) After that, take chocolate (any choco-
        late will work but I recommend dark chocolate cuz it contains anti oxidants) and cut 
        little pieces of it. Take your mixer or grinder or juicer(any of these will work) and 
        pour that cooled down milk in vessel of juicer and add chocolate in it.  Add sugar
        as per your taste and if you want it cooled couple cubes of ice. Mix it for 5-6 minutes.
        And you are ready with your milkshake. Garnish it by some chocolate sryup.</p>
        
        <p> So your Chocolate Milkshake is ready to go</p>
